30 October 2012 v2.0.0
+ Added Premium support
+ Added favorites support
+ Using JSON to get streams addresses instead of parsing the HTML for them
+ Added an indication of what quality the stream is, shown as i.e: 64 kb
* Complete rewrite of the codebase, making it more modular and generally awesomer
* Using Sky.fms own JSON data to find streams, instead of parsing the HTML by RegEx
* Changed the highlight color of new channels from orange to blue, as the "currently playing" channel is orange in the default skin for Eden
* Changed default refresh rate from 360 (6 hours) to 720 hours (12 hours)

Thanks to Daniel Connelly for making me aware of the JSON data and for being my willing guinea pig ;)


27 May 2012 v1.0.0
+ Initial release
+ Support for public/free streams
+ Added a testStream method to HTTPComm, to check if a url is streaming
- No premium support yet, theres some logic that I have to sort out first, regarding different stream formats (Flash/AAC/MP3)
